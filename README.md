# Seed

A simple note-taking application built to grow understanding of web frameworks.

Seed is a learning-focused project where the same note-taking application is implemented across multiple frameworks (Laravel, Rails, and others). Each implementation follows the same features and architecture to highlight differences in routing, MVC patterns, authentication, database design, and testing.

The goal of Seed is not just to store notes, but to plant ideas and grow practical framework knowledge through comparison and repetition.
